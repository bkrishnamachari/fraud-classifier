"""Simple tutorial for classifying bitcoin addresses using an MLP.

This script expects three CSV files that contain a **small balanced subset**
of the Elliptic dataset.  The subset has a total of 9,090 transactions: 4,545
licit (label ``0``) and 4,545 illicit (label ``1``).  Each transaction is
represented by only the first 100 features (out of the original 166) from the
full dataset.

See original Elliptic dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set

# 1. Load the preprocessed subset of the Elliptic dataset
#    - ``elliptic_balanced_features.csv`` contains ``txId`` plus the first 100
#      feature columns from the original 166
#    - ``elliptic_balanced_classes.csv`` provides the label for each
#      transaction (``0`` = licit, ``1`` = illicit)
